<h1>Game Features</h1>
The game is quite simple in comparison to others. Using WASD, the goal of the game is to take a walk though the quiet suburbs. While exploring, there's leaves that continuously fall, the sound of a breeze, and other types of outdoorsy white noise. The character we play as is not seen nor heard by the player. All the player recieves about the character is the dialogue spoken through text located at the top of the screen. In the short playthrough, the player gets to enjoy the serene atmosphere and calmness, feeling at peace with both the game and themselves.

<h1>Settings</h1>
This game features three distinct areas. The first place the player experiences is what I will call 'Inside.' There is not much shown to the user or featured in this area other than a window. When the player walks through the window, they end up 'Outside.' This is where the player spends most of the gameplay. The area is a pastel suburb which is then filled with drawings the more the player explores. Once the player reaches the end of the path, they will then enter a new area which I call 'The Unknown.' This is where the end of the gameplay takes place. There is not much in this area, as there is just a road and a building straight ahead. Once we go through the building's entrance, the game ends, as the outdoor walk has ended.

<h1>Interactions</h1>
Throughout the walk, different drawings appear as the player continues to explore the 'Outside.' These drawings could be of people or items that range from a basketball to clothing. At first, these drawings do not appear to have any meaning behind them. However, I like to think these drawings are the player's memories. The player goes on this walk seemingly to feel better during a mental health issue. That's why I think these drawings are memories, because the walk allows the player to reminisce on the good moment's they have had in their life. For example, The only being that exists in this game other than the player is a cat. I believe this cat was once a stray that the player then took in. With the cat is a drawing of a bowl and a person looking at the cat. I like to think the drawing is the player feeding the cat for the first time, which would then lead to them adopting the cat.

<h1>Thoughts</h1>
I thought this game was beautiful. From the color palate to the meaning behind it all, I enjoyed this short walk. Not only did it remind me of the good times I have had, but it also made me calm during a time of stress. I enjoyed the gameplay and thought it was very well done.
