Hi! My name is Hadleigh Jae Bills. I am 20-years-old, and I am currently a Junior at Penn State Behrend.

Ever since I was young, I've always had a big imagination. Whether it be drawing, performing, or writing, I would always try to create something using these creative outlets. I think of my life as one big art project, and I want it to be a masterpiece.

During my short 20 years on this planet, I have performed in over 35 shows, directed three show, and so much more! At the moment, however, my main focus is on getting through my fifth semester of college and making that experience the best it can be!</div>
